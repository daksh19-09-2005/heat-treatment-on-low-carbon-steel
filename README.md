## 🔬 Heat Treatment Techniques

| Process       | Temperature & Cooling | Resulting Structure        | Effect                        |
|---------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Annealing** | Heated to 1100°C, slow furnace cooling | Coarse ferrite + pearlite     | Softens, increases ductility |
| **Normalizing** | Heated to 1100°C, air cooled     | Refined ferrite + pearlite    | Strengthens, improves toughness |
| **Quenching** | Heated to 1100°C, rapid water/oil cooling | Martensite (needle-like)      | Maximizes hardness, adds brittleness |

## ⚙️ Experimental Procedure

1. **Heating**: All samples heated to 1100°C to transform to austenitic phase.
2. **Cooling**:
   - Quenched in water/oil
   - Annealed in furnace
   - Normalized in air
3. **Sample Preparation**:
   - Surface grinding using sandpaper
   - Polishing using cloth and abrasive
4. **Microstructure Observation**:
   - Metallurgical microscope used
5. **Hardness Testing**:
   - Vickers Hardness Test applied

## 🧫 Microstructural Observations

### 🔵 Annealed Steel:
- Coarse ferrite-pearlite structure
- Large grain size, equiaxed grains
- Soft, ductile, low hardness

### 🟡 Normalized Steel:
- Refined, uniform ferrite-pearlite
- Balanced strength and toughness
- Moderate hardness

### 🔴 Quenched Steel:
- Needle-like martensitic structure
- High hardness, low ductility
- Internal residual stresses present

## 📊 Hardness Results (Vickers HV)

| Treatment   | Hardness Range (HV) |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Annealed    | 206 – 222           |
| Normalized  | 225 – 251           |
| Quenched    | 442 – 463           |

- **Annealed**: Lowest hardness, best machinability
- **Normalized**: Intermediate, balanced mechanical behavior
- **Quenched**: Highest hardness, brittle, requires tempering for improved toughness

---

## 💡 Discussion

- **Quenching** yields highest hardness due to martensitic transformation but compromises ductility.
- **Annealing** creates a soft structure with excellent ductility and stress relief.
- **Normalizing** provides a balance of strength, hardness, and toughness—ideal for structural applications.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Heat treatment significantly alters the microstructure and mechanical behavior of mild steel. Choosing the right method depends on the intended application:

- Use **quenching** for high-strength, wear-resistant tools.
- Use **annealing** for parts requiring machinability and formability.
- Use **normalizing** where a balance of properties is required.

> Future research can explore **tempering quenched samples** to optimize toughness while preserving hardness.
